## A. Use ARIMA for High Frequence Trade
>  The model predicts changes in the VWAP (volume weighted average prices) based on historical observations of the VWMAP and an exogenous variable, the current Order Flow Imbalance (OFI).

> Applying the Dickey-Fuller test to establish stationarity of the endogenous series, followed by use of the ACF and PACF to identify the ARIMA model order.
