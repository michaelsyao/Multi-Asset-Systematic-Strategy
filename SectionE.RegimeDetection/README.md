# Regime Detection and HMM
```
This section cover Regime Detection and Hidden Markov Modeling  
```
## A. HMM_Viterbi
>  The algorithm will determine the most likely sequence of hidden states, i.e. whether the coin that generated the data was likely fair or loaded.
The example easily maps onto financial markets: Bull or Bear, Normal or Dislocated, etc.

> This can easily maps onto financial markets: Bull or Bear, Normal or Dislocated, etc.

## B. Kalman_Filters
>  This show particle filtering to stochastic volatility modeling.
